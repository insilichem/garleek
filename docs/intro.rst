Introduction
============

Garleek allows you to perform QM/MM calculations by interfacing Gaussian with MM programs via its ``external`` keyword.

Supported software
------------------

Garleek currently supports the following programs. It expects them to be available in ``$PATH``.

QM engines
..........

- Gaussian 16
- Gaussian 09A, 09B, 09C, 09D

MM engines
..........

- TINKER 8.1 (only ``analyze``, ``testgrad`` and ``testhess`` are needed)


How does it work
----------------

WIP.
